## Description

_This is a Pig Dice game with options for playing with one die or two dice. Players take turns rolling a die or dice. They can decide to continue rolling to acrue potential points or "hold" and add those potential points to their score. Certain roll combinations, however, may cause a turn to end and all potential points to be lost._

## Specifications
One Die
* Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

Two Dice
* Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
* If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
* If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
* If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game)
